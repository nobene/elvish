Elvish is:

-   A powerful scripting language.

-   A shell with useful interactive features built-in.

-   A statically linked binary for Linux, BSDs, macOS or Windows.

Elvish is pre-1.0. This means that breaking changes will still happen from time
to time, but it's stable enough for both scripting and interactive use.
