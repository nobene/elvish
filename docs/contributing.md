# Process for contributing to Elvish

The only person with direct commit access is the project's founder @xiaq. If you
intend to make user-visible changes to Elvish's behavior (as opposed to fixing
typos and obvious bugs), it is good idea to talk to him first; this will make it
easier to review your changes. He should be reachable in the user group most of
the time.

On the other hand, if you find it easier to express your thoughts directly in
code, it is also completely fine to directly send a pull request, as long as you
don't mind the risk of the PR being rejected due to lack of prior discussion.

## Licensing

By contributing, you agree to license your code under the same license as
existing source code of Elvish. See the [README](../README.md) at the project
root for the license.
