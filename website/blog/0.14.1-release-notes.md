Version 0.14.1 has been released on 2020-08-16, a month and a half after 0.14.0.
This is a bugfix release. If you upgraded from 0.13.x, please also read the
[0.14.0 release notes](0.14.0-release-notes.html).

As usual, [prebuilt binaries](https://elv.sh/get) are offered for most common
platforms.

This release fixes the lack of deprecation warnings in
[imported modules](https://b.elv.sh/1072) and when using the `explode` builtin.
There are no new features.
