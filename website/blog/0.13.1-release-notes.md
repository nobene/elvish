Version 0.13.1 has been released on 2020-03-21, less than 3 months after 0.13.
This is a bugfix release. If you upgraded from 0.12, please also read the
[0.13 release notes](0.13-release-notes.html).

As usual, [prebuilt binaries](https://elv.sh/get) are offered for most common
platforms.

The following bugs have been fixed: [#883](https://b.elv.sh/883),
[#891](https://b.elv.sh/891), [#852](https://b.elv.sh/852),
[#788](https://b.elv.sh/788).

A single new feature has been introduced: the `edit:redraw` function now accepts
a `full` option. When true, it forces Elvish to do a full redraw, as opposed to
an incremental redraw.
