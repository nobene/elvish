@module doc

# Introduction

The `doc:` module provides access to the documentation of Elvish modules.

This module only supports builtin modules now, but will expand in future to
cover user-defined modules too.

Function usages are given in the same format as in the reference doc for the
[builtin module](builtin.html).
