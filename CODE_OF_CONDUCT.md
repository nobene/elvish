The Elvish community follows the
[Go community code of conduct](https://go.dev/conduct).

The short version:

-   Treat everyone with respect and kindness.

-   Be thoughtful in how you communicate.

-   Don't be destructive or inflammatory.

-   If you encounter an issue, please contact xiaq via Telegram, Matrix or
    Discord DM or email (xiaqqaix@gmail.com). (We don't have a team of stewards
    or a committee of representatives (yet).)

Consistent with the Go community code of conduct, the following specific points
apply:

-   Respect how other people choose to use Elvish and their system in general.

    Elvish is opinionated software, but that doesn't mean the use cases Elvish
    chooses not to support are inherently bad.
